Scala Functions vs Scala Methods:
functions and methods are not the same in Scala

Methods are functions that can access state of the class
method is something defined with a def
a value is something you can assign to a val, like first class functions that
would be considered as values

methods are not values, functions are values

Methods cannot be assigned to variables nor passed as parameters to functions or other methods. If you need to do this, you have to convert the method into a function.

unlike methods, functions are not invoked on an object. Functions are simply called and passed arguments, while methods are invoked on an object and passed arguments

But Scala also provides a shortcut for converting a method into a function. If you invoke the method on its object with no parentheses or parameters and follow it with an underscore, Scala will automatically convert it to a function for you : also known as eta expansion postfix operator

here is some good stuff written abt methods vs functions
